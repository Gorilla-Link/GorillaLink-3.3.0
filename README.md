## About

ExpressLRS is an open source Radio Link for Radio Control applications. Designed to be the best FPV Racing link, it is based on the fantastic Semtech **SX127x**/**SX1280** LoRa hardware combined with an Espressif or STM32 Processor. Using LoRa modulation as well as reduced packet size it achieves best in class range and latency. It achieves this using a highly optimized over-the-air packet structure, giving simultaneous range and latency advantages. It supports both 900 MHz and 2.4 GHz links, each with their own benefits. 900 MHz supports a maximum of 200 Hz packet rate, with higher penetration. 2.4 GHz supports a blistering fast 1000 Hz on [EdgeTX](http://edgetx.org/). With over 60 different hardware targets and 13 hardware manufacuturers, the choice of hardware is ever growing, with different hardware suited to different requirements.

## Configurator
To configure your ExpressLRS hardware, the ExpressLRS Configurator can be used, which is found here:
